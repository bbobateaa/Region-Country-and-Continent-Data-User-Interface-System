# Region-Country-and-Continent-Data-User-Interface-System
This is a user interface system that allows users to search for a region, country, and continent which takes information from a SQL database and displays it to the user in the GUI. 

User should run main and a GUI window will pop up. The user can search for a region, country, or continent in the search bars. Edits are also to be made or adding new elements to region, country, or continent is also allowed. Any changes made by the user updates and saves to the SQL database! The written SQL queries are also injection protected so any injections cannot be made to break into the database that should not be allowed.
